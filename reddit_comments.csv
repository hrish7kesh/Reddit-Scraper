1jczjvz,Looking to learn Python to learn backtesting and algo trading. Any good resources/advice anyone can share? Thanks
1jczjvz,"What's the modern way to access rendered web pages with Python? I'm working on a project that uses selenium webdriver, and it works, but I wonder if there are other alternatives out there, preferably ones that don't require having Chrome installed. I heard playwright can be used for this sort of thing?"
1jczjvz,i need help to use ai in python
1jeapm0,"There is a fundamental difference between if - if and if - elif:
When you chain if statements, python will check every if statements, no matter what is the outcome of the previous one. 
With if-elif, the elif statement is evaluated ONLY if the first if statement evaluates to False. 
Elif literally mean else if, so if the IF statements evaluates to true, python will ignore the elif statements.

If you chain elif statements, same story. The outcome of the first if determines if the rest of the conditions are checked or not."
1jeapm0,"Elif is generally better as it will only check the next conditions if the previous if was false, else it should just skip it"
1jeapm0,"Ppl have answered about the if elif 

But you mention that you have ordered them by computational complexity. You may want to also consider based on likelihood. 

It can be less expensive if you do a highly likely but costly test first rather than doing several less costly and working your way up."
1jeapm0,"If-elif-elif when the conditions partition the behavior cleanly.

If-chains when subsequent actions may be needed on the results of the previous condition.

Nested-if when there are distinct sub conditions. But use this sparingly.

For performance reasons it's often a good strategy to do a cheap check to partition the behavior so that the expensive checks are not done on all the data."
1jeapm0,"The answer is either; it doesn't matter or use if-elif-elif.

The reason for it doesn't matter: if your code looks like this:
```
if condition1:
    return False
if condition2:
    return False
...
return True
```
Then the `return` statement will prevent evaluation of the following conditions.

Otherwise if you are not returning or breaking out of the loop, you should use if-elif-elif, otherwise every conditional statement that evaluates to true will have its clause executed. 

Some food for thought -- you want your conditionals to be ordered by *likelihood of execution* in the best case scenario. That means if condition 1 is computationally heavy, but is also the executed case 90% of the time, it should be first in your conditional chain. That way 90% of the time, it's the only case executed instead of ""every less computationally heavy case, then this case"" being executed.

You may not know which case will be the most executed, so your ordering would make sense as an initial release - then tracking which gets executed the most, to make a future performance commit."
1jeapm0,If elif elif allows you to stop immediately if the condition is true at an early stage. It does not evaluate all if clauses.
1jeapm0,"one variable can resolve to True in multiple if statements, so these two are not the same and it depends on your intended behavior...

example:

```
x = int

if x > 8:
    print(""It is bigger than 8"")
if x > 6:
    print(""It is bigger than 6"")
if x > 4:
    print(""It is bigger than 4"")
```

if x = 10, this will result in:
```
> It is bigger than 8
> It is bigger than 6
> It is bigger than 4
```

now, if you code it like this:

```
x = int

if x > 8:
    print(""It is bigger than 8"")
elif x > 6:
    print(""It is bigger than 6"")
elif x > 4:
    print(""It is bigger than 4"")
```

if x = 10 it will result in:

```
> It is bigger than 8
```

And if x = 7 it will result in:

```
> It is bigger than 6
```

So check if your outcomes should be mutually exclusive or not."
1jeapm0,"The expression after elif is only evaluated if the preceeding (el)if expression was falsy.

With a sequence of if statements it depends. Are they nested or on the same level? If they are at the same level, every one of them will be checked, unless of course there are other control statements inside those if suits like `return` or `break`."
1jeapm0,"I'm a bit of an idiot, sorry. What is meant by ""computationally expensive""?"
1jeapm0,"is the computationally expensive calculation the same in each if/elif, but just checking for different values?  
If so, either calculate it before the first if, or use the walrus := to capture it so you don't have to do it again:

    if (calc_res := 1 + 2 + 3) == 7:
        print('it was 7')
    elif calc_res == 5:
        print('it was 5')
    else:
        print(f'it was {calc_res}')"
1jeapm0,"odd one out here i guess, try match case

    for val in calculations:
      match (val):
        case <val1>:
          <do the thing>
        case <val2>:
          <do a different thing>
        ...
        case _:
          <default action>"
1jeapm0,"To throw in my 2cts, I always prefer to put this in a separate function and then do if return, if return, in my mind that makes the code easier to understand no matter, you can then also do things like @lru_cache if possible! The order for ifs, indeed a mix of expense and likelihood as other people have noted"
1jeapm0,"one variable can conform to True in multiple if statements, so these two are not the same and it depends on your intended behavior...

example:

```
x = int

if x > 8:
    print(""It is bigger than 8"")
if x > 6:
    print(""It is bigger than 6"")
if x > 4:
    print(""It is bigger than 4"")
```

if x = 10, this will result in:
```
> It is bigger than 8
> It is bigger than 6
> It is bigger than 4
```

now, if you code it like this:

```
x = int

if x > 8:
    print(""It is bigger than 8"")
elif x > 6:
    print(""It is bigger than 6"")
elif x > 4:
    print(""It is bigger than 4"")
```

if x = 10 it will result in:

```
It is bigger than 8
```

And if x = 7 it will result in:

```
It is bigger than 6
```

So check if your outcomes should be mutually exclusive or not."
1je2zuu,"Ditch the AI, I think you’re trying to move too fast without learning the basics. This is a very common post here.  

If I write something, I may take 50 lines to write it initially, with extra print statements to help me debug it. If I clean it all up once I have it working, my solution may then be as long as the AI version, but I’ve learned how and why the code works, and probably learned a lot that will make me better for next time. Shortcutting my learning process is just hurting me."
1je2zuu,"""But I can’t write too much python by hand and make full apps completely from scratch without AI to learn more.""

**So stop using AI.** If you forget something then look it up in the docs, you don't need to remember everything. You are your best teacher. Code and actually deal with problems on your own.

For more resources Harvard CS50, MOOC - University of Helsinki course and I have a [Python and Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-foundations-for-data-science-from-zero-to-data-analy/?couponCode=FEB2025-PYTHON) course that starts from scratch are all amazing. However if you don't actually do the homework on your own and let ChatGPT do the work for you then you will not progress."
1je2zuu,"If you are fogetting things, then you are moving too fast.

Everytime you learn something important like functions, loops, class and etc. you should build a project around that topic to fully understand and at least im print the important parts of that topic.

Document what you have learnt every single step of the way, on google doc or other note apps, then you can simply use the search function and search when you forget or get stuck"
1je2zuu,"You should be focused on what you need to do and not hung up on remembering every bit of code you’ve written before. People will tell you over and over that it’s impossible to remember everything. Look up the documentation if you don’t remember.

Most importantly, you need to start building your own projects. Come up with a problem you want to solve, map/draw it out broken down into steps, write code to complete each step."
1je2zuu,"First step is to stop using AI. Think of Gen AI like power tools. In the hands of a skilled craftsman, power tools can really reduce their workload and help them to create great things faster. In the hands of a novice without fundamentals, they can really help the novice lose a few fingers. AI is great for me because it can take care of a lot of the boring part of the job for me. That’s fine in my case though because I already know how to do the boring part of the job and I’m just outsourcing it.

What does doing a project look like to you? When you do projects from “automate the boring stuff” do you sit down and try to understand what you’ve written/copied or do you simply mark the project as done in your head and move on?"
1je2zuu,Stop using AI and just do the coding exercises on your own. If you keep using it as a crutch you're never gonna develop the fundamental understanding of coding you need to figure things out logically.
1je2zuu,"Turn off the AI, find a project  you want to make that is complex enough, e.g. a social media website, then start working on that project. It will be bad, but you will iterate on it and learn how to do things by stucking at difficult issues."
1je2zuu,"Don't use AI to learn Python. It spits out code of dubious quality and you don't know yet if it is any good or not. Make a small project: hangman in the terminal. Expand from there. DO NOT use AI/LLM unless you are truly stuck for an hour and tried multiple things. Take a walk, try again."
1je2zuu,I learned a lot from watching The Coding Train on Youtube. Trying to port his javascript code over to Python.
1je2zuu,"Is it perhaps more of a problem solving/solution design issue than a coding issue? Are you thinking through what you have to do in terms of inputs and outputs, and decomposing the problem onto different parts that make it easier to approach? 

It can feel very intimidating to tackle big problems, but if you sit down, draw a flowchart or a diagram to picture it and divide it into smaller, less intimidating chunks, it's going to be easier to figure out what to do next, it narrows down what to search for if there's something you don't know how to do, and it makes you a better solution designer overall."
1je2zuu,Start small and simple then build. Repetition.
1je2zuu,"Im the same. I’m making scripts and I can read them debug the code. But doing from 0 is hard. You can tell me to read the python documentation but for example the docs for imaplib are horrible, a third party can make a better job than the python docs at explaining something. And maybe the problem is the people just looking up things in the python docs and AI. Start looking in stack overflow. Code examples, explanations"
1je2zuu,"I agree with the ditch the AI suggestion, here is how:  
Work with a relatively lesser known series of project packages OR something somewhat new with good documentation but hasn't been trained into any AI's.  
Anything you've come across (pyside6, Vector databases for me) which AI routinely gets wrong is a great place to self-sabotage your inner vibe-coder/AI shortcutting.

Ironically enough I learned the most by writing my own AI instancing & API handling software with chain of thought, NLP, and vector based memories - it was a tremendous project and an AI was only useful to the point of asking philosophical questions about structuring. I was knee deep in documentation all day for hours on end before i realized. It was a project I was enthusiastic about enough to not care about a lack of shortcuts and it offered many small victories."
1je2zuu,"Stop using AI to learn. You need a foundation first to learn honestly, and one of the things about coding is that in order to get good at it, you have to start making your own mistakes and spend time figuring out why you made your mistakes (this could be doing your own research). AI is too quick to give you responses about what is the correct answer and you'll gloss over the intricacies and just copy and paste the right solution."
1je2zuu,"one of the worst ways of learning something new from the start is using AI. You will get wrong information that you are unable to discern it from being true or false, and you will learn how to use the ai to do X stuff, but you wont learn how to do X stuff yourself..


And there is a huge difference.


Ditch the AI and relearn everything from scratch, yourself alone. There's no other way"
1je2zuu,"That looks like a symptom of passive learning. I’d reflect on how many decisions you had to make from idea to implementation. If most of the decisions are already made by AI, there’s the issue.

If you are working on Automate the Boring Stuff in Python, try to add new features on the existing code without adding additional 3rd party libraries. That will test your true understanding of the codebase."
1je2zuu,Hackerrank.com is your best friend
1je2zuu,You need to enjoy Python if you want to learn it. AI stuff is too difficult for a starter. Just build a simple web site or a simple card game works on terminal. After you see visual results you will start to enjoy the process and you can advance in Python.
1je2zuu,"The reason you’re not remembering is because you’re using AI,

You’re using it as a crutch.

When learning, you shouldn’t be using AI to write code for you, and you should never be copy and pasting.

You need to physically write all the code yourself."
1je2zuu,"Learning - Don't use AI to write for you. Use it as a dictionary to look up definitions/terms. Not as a freelance author that write for you.

Using when you are pro - Up to you"
1je2zuu,“several months” lol there’s your problem. it takes a long time to be productive autonomously
1je2zuu,"Stop using AI. You need to write more code. Break your task down into smaller bits then complete each bit. If you can’t remember how to do something or you forget syntax, it’s ok to look it up in the documentation. Nobody remembers everything.

If it’s an app you’re writing, start small. First just get a basic window up with a single button or whatever that doesn’t do anything. And check this works. Fix any bugs. Then add some basic logic for that button, then check this works. Then add a little more functionality, then check it works. Rinse and repeat. Do not write the entire logic all in one go before you check it works. Keep a copy of a previous version in case you mess up (or better yet, use version control such as git).

Make sure you write code that is *readable*. This will save your life as you write code because it avoid confusing yourself. If you litter you code with variable names such as “a” and “v1”, you will just confuse yourself. Instead write variable names like “car” or “person” or whatever. Divide long pieces of code into functions. Keep the top level code simple to read and put nitty gritty details inside functions. If your logic is complicated, you can even start by writing the logic using functions you haven’t defined yet. This process forces you to think about the problem and what you need."
1je2zuu,"Your brain learns by the struggle of doing. Using AI bypasses the bits you’d learn from. Do it the hard way. He’ll, do it wrong, and ask others to help you understand how to do it better. I’ve written entire modules I learned later could be done much more easily- or could be entirely replaced by standard libraries. But doing that work is how I learned."
1je2zuu,"Stop using AI. 

Also, I'll let you in on a secret, but don't tell anyone - we forget most of the things we learn. I can never remember if it's `.index` or `.find`, or which one raises an exception and which one fails gracefully. I also can't remember if you can do `dict + dict`, or if it is `dict | dict`, or maybe`dict.extend(dict)`?

Memorizing is never the point. You get experience from running into problems and solving them, so that the next time you run into the same problem you take less time figuring out what to do. If your solution is AI, then you're not gaining any experience."
1je2zuu,"> and can understand AI’s writing of python if i do use it for anything. 


STOP USING AI

FIGURE STUFF OUT ON YOUR OWN"
1je2zuu,Reading code is a secondary skill to googling.
1je2zuu,Why people think they can write full things with only a few months? did we lower the back for programmers? did things advance so rapidly I missed something?
1je2zuu,"I would recommend books like Clean Code or [Architecture Patterns with Python](https://www.cosmicpython.com/).  It sounds like your problem is less Python syntax and more 'Now that I know how to handle the pieces, how do I put them all together?'  And that's a much bigger question with a lot more work to be done to understand design patterns, architecture philosophies, etc.  

Edit:  Head First Design Patterns is also a good book.  It's written in Java, but you can reason through how to implement the code in Python as you go.  It's a good primer on different design strategies."
1je2zuu,"Don't use Ai like chatGPT or DeepSeek try using CS50.ai, you will need a github account tho. While chatGPT and DeepSeek generates a code for you, Cs50 won't write you code, but will help with ideas.
Also what others said.(yeah I'm lazy, my bad)"
1jebbty,"By default you can only make specific widgets scroll with a scrollbar, such as tree lists, lists, multiple-lines entry boxes and canvas...

One trick to make multiple widgets scrollable is to make a canvas, make it scrollable then put a frame in it, then you can scroll through the widgets within that frame, but it's a little iffy... You also have to use binds for that, instead of just setting the scrollbar as the scroll of the canvas... it's pretty macguyverism, and in the end you're almost programming the scroll effect from zero, but at the end it works...

I wouldn't recommend doing it without some experiencs, and you'll be knocking your head against a hard wall while learning it."

❤️

This mindset starts early. I’d recommend looking into Domain-Driven Design (DDD). Carefully consider where your business logic will reside—ideally, isolated from external dependencies. Think through your abstractions clearly from the start.

Following these practices will help ensure your code is easy to modify:

* Practice good separation of concerns. Your core business logic should be framework-agnostic and independent.
* Choose frameworks thoughtfully, and minimize coupling as much as practically possible—though, admittedly, in Python, this can range from difficult to impossible due to the nature of frameworks.
* Avoid embedding direct database or external service calls (like raw SQL, SQLAlchemy, or Redis) directly within business logic. Instead, abstract these external services behind protocols or interfaces, and implement your concrete classes separately.

Doing this makes your system far easier to adapt and modify in the future."

1je1gwp,"Hey there! If you’re totally new to Python, I’d suggest starting with something like **“Automate the Boring Stuff with Python”**—it’s free and really beginner-friendly. Once you’re comfy with the basics, check out resources like **Kaggle** for hands-on machine learning projects. They have free datasets and mini-courses that’ll help you see how Python fits into ML.

If you ever want more structured help or a mentor to guide you (especially once you start diving into machine learning), let me know. Happy to point you to good resources or discuss a plan to level up your skills. Good luck and have fun learning!"

1jdyh7z,"Hello, I think you are are confusing Papyrus (Bethesda's scripting language for creation engine) with python, even then Papyrus only handles scripting, it is not the game ""engine"". You can make games with python but they are going to have to be 2d. They are not going to be 3d unless you are going to seriously sacrifice graphical fidelity (near doom graphics).With that said here is a good resource for getting started in Python if you are still interested. https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide"

Here is the official tutorial.

1jdyh7z,"Take a look at ""The Farmer Was Replaced"" on Steam, it's early access, but it's a game where you basically program a drone in Python, it should serve as a good introduction into what programming is about"
1jdyh7z,"okay quick question to everybody, what is the coolest thing that one can do with code is it something other than making good games? I see games as a way of storytelling where the outcome depends on our actions and perhaps that's story telling at it's best and since the dawn of humanity we all have been seeking some good stories, in this context can anyone please tell me the coolest thing one can do with coding? I am gonna pursue that."
1jdx2ot,"I would change the game to a class and a while loop instead of using globals and recursion. 
```
class Game:
        def __init__(self):
            self.boss_health = 100
            self.mana = 30

       if action.lower() == ""q"":
          print(""Thanks for playing"")
          break

1jdx2ot,"Breaking your interactions and actions inf to functions. 


Form the code, it looks like you are newer to programming so this one might be a ways away. If you can break your characters into objects classes. Yes it will be way more complicated to create your characters/bosses but the heath and other such attributes (and death/victory sequences) can be self contained to the character. This would allow you to focus on your game code a lot more and you can make the game story way longer with out have as much repetitive code on characters."
1jdx2ot,"First thing I notice is your variables. Rather than declaring them as global variables at the start of your function, it would be better to pass them as arguments. 

Declare what your arguments are when setting up the function:
``` def load(bossheslth, health, mana, defend) ```

Then, pass those variables to the function when you call it at the bottom:

``` load(bossheslth, health, mana, defend) ```

It would probably also be a good time to learn about splitting your code into separate functions, modules and classes. Especially for something like a game, you would have things look a lot cleaner and more organized when you start splitting up your code by purpose. Having your printed strings in one module and handling user input in another, etc."
1jdx2ot,"Use functions for attacks, calculating health, calculate mama and win condition.it will be a good practice."
1jdx2ot,"As a rule of thumb, global variables should not be used. There can be exceptions but exceptions are not the rule so for an entire game, you probably don't want global variables called mana etc.

For a tiny program, it is not a big problem, but habits stay, so don't make bad ones from the start."
1jdx2ot,"There's a common guideline in programming known as DRY: ""Don't Repeat Yourself"".
This is basically the idea that when you see yourself writing the same block of code over and over,
see if you can restructure your code so that this is put somewhere common that you do only once.
While not always to be slavishly followed, it's a good guideline, especially starting out.
Not only does repetition clutter up your code, it can easily lead to bugs where you fix something in one place, 
but forget about one of the other 9 places you need to make the same change.

Eg. here, notice that after every action, you have:

    time.sleep(1)
    load()
    
So why not remove this from every action, and put it **outside** the if.

Indeed, you've kind of already got a bug in your code related to this where these things you should be doing every time aren't
always called - consider what happens when you select ""heal"" without having enough mana.


Second, you're looping by re-calling the `load()` function at the end of each action.  This is known as ""tail recursion"",
and isn't really a good idea in python.  You're basically creating a new invocation of the function, which is just going to
pile up iterations until you reach a limit (1000 by default) before python thinks you've probably got an unbounded recursion
error in your code and raises an exception.

The standard way to do this in python is not recursion, but rather a loop, such as a while loop.  Eg:

    is_running = True
    
    while is_running:
        if defend == 0: 
            ... rest of your code
            
And remove the calls to `load()`

You might also want to consider moving the various actions into their own functions.  Ie. instead of being in the body of the load() function,
have seperate `fire`, `heal`, `charge` etc functions that you **call** from the load function.  Ie:

    if move == ""load"":
        load()
    elif move == ""heal"":
        heal()
    ...
    
This can break things down into smaller chunks that just do one thing which can help with organisation.

For a slightly more advanced technique, you could even potentially use a dictionary to get rid of the if block altogether by something like:

    ship_actions = {
        ""fire"": fire,
        ""heal"": heal,
        ...
    }
    
And in your loop do:

    action = ship_actions.get(move)
    if action is not None:
        action()
    else:
        print(""Invalid input 😔"")
        defend = 1
        

Next, you're using global variables to track the various stats being changed (note that if you do break things into functions, these will need the global declaration for the things they change too).  While this is OK when learning and you haven't learned about more advanced features to manage state, it's generally strongly frowned upon in any real code, as with bigger programs it quickly becomes complex to reason about when and what changes them.

Instead, it's better for functions to take inputs they need and return outputs.  This can get cumbersome if you're changing multiple things, so a useful approach is to **bundle** this state into a class.  This is perhaps a bit more of an advanced topic, so don't worry too much about it if just starting out, but its something worth learning as you get the hang of the basics:

Think of classes as bundles of variables, or more accurately, as *blueprints* that create bundles of variables.  Eg we could define a Game class like:

    class Game:
        def __init__(self):
            self.bosshealth = 100
            self.mana = 30
            self.health = 100
            self.defend = 0
           
The `__init__` function is a special function for classes (called an **initialiser**) that sets it up.  ""self"" is a variable that refers to the instance object being created by it, so its what
we're creating these variables on.  The ""."" notation means ""access the variable on this instance""
           
If you now do:

    game = Game()
    
The `game` variable will now be an **instance** of the game class with variables initialised to those values.  Ie. instead of using `mana = mana - 10`, you'd write `game.mana = game.mana - 10`.
You can now pass this game object in as an argument to your functions, and modify it and get rid of the global variables entirely.

Going a bit further, classes are actually a bit more than bundles of variables - they can also bundle **functions** as well (called ""methods"").  Eg. we could make those `move`, `fire` etc functions associated with the class.  Eg:


    class Game:
        def __init__(): ... # as before
        
        def fire(self):
            if self.mana > 10:
                self.bosshealth = self.bosshealth - 10
                self.mana = self.mana - 10
                print(""BOOM"")
            else:
                print(""Not enough mana"")
                
        # ... add the other functions too
                
Again the ""self"" argument is a special argument that corresponds to the instance object we're invoked on.
Now instead of calling `fire(game)`, we can do:

    game.fire()
    
And it'll call that method."

1je6lpx,I'm not sure how anyone could answer that.
1je6lpx,I'd recommend doing some sanity checks - try to reduce the problem space to something small and trivial and make sure you get what you expect. Then try to build up from there.
1je6lpx,"(a) What is the total number of possible outcomes?

(b) How fast can your program analyze one outcome?

Multiply your answers to (a) and (b) above, and your program should find a solution in that amount of time. Since it is an optimization problem, it should need to examine every outcome, so it probably won't finish sooner than that[.](https://www.reddit.com/user/ovi_left_faceoff/)"
1je6lpx,"Let's say your 60 variables are binary decision variables, 0 or 1.

Then there are 2\^60 = 1.15 x 10\^18 possible combinations. If your program can do 10\^9 per second (which would be very fast), it should only take 36.5 years to finish.

This is why combinatorial optimization is so difficult and there is so much interest in finding ways to speed up the search. As a general rule, shortcuts depend on the details of your problem.

Often there are heuristics, approaches which are known to give (probably) a ""pretty good"" rather than an optimal solutions. Sometimes there are even proofs that the heuristic will give a solution that's within, say, a factor of 2 of the optimal. If you're looking for good enough instead of perfect, this might be the strategy you want to pursue.

One heuristic that sometimes works is to solve the problem as a linear program rather than an integer programming one. LP algorithms are much faster. That means that you're allowing values that aren't integers, so then you have to have a rounding procedure that forces all the fractional solutions to be valid integers.

You might also be able to factor your problem into smaller ones. Again, the strategy depends on the details."
1je6lpx,What library? How many graph edges?
1je6lpx,"Sometimes having MORE constraints actually helps to reduce the problem instead of making it more difficult.

Do you have soft constraints and an objective function (cost) that you minimize? If so, ORtools will try to find an optimal solution (or prove that the current solution is optimal), which might not be necessary in your case; perhaps you can be happy with a solution that doesn't violate any hard constraints...? If so, you can get it by setting the time limit.

Do you limit your IntVars (lower & upper bound) as much as possible? Perhaps you can only use BoolVars instead?

Do you use multiple workers? I would try 8, 16, 24 and 32 on a computer with many CPU cores."
1je6lpx,"Best place to start would be to calculate your max possible combinations.

Then you want to check if there are loops in your code

Then you should start looking into multiprocessing

There was an Advent of Code question this year where the solution was 300 trillion entries long. (You had to return the total count, and the trick was not to generate and count, but to cache and count). My point is that things can easily get very large, very fast."

1jduzsz,"u/Alarming-Evidence525 First, there seems to be a typo in the code you've written there - should \`fetch\_page()\` be \`scrape\_page()\`, as the latter is what you refer to in your \`scrape\_batch()\` function? By the way, I'm not convinced the batching is helping you here. Since you have long sleeps and timeouts within your functions (for good reason), it might be that you spend a long time waiting for the last few ""tail"" tasks in the batch to finish. Without the batching, not only would you simplify the code, but the async logic would be able to move on to the next tasks without waiting for the difficult ones to complete.

I applaud you for putting in sleeps, but I still think that you are effectively hammering the endpoint when the batch starts since all of the tasks begin shortly after one another (due to the nature of async). I would really recommend putting a small but random (async) sleep ahead of each request, to spread out your calls. 

  
More broadly, I think you're going to struggle make this much faster from a single IP. I'm sure there is rate limiting and your code implies it, too. It's just difficult to get away from the fundamental fact that a single user (IP) makes requests to an endpoint at a given rate, whether using async or not. You could do proxies, or you could go for multiple machines with a global task queue. Both entail a chunk more work.

However, downloading an existing open-weight model like Gemma, Llama, etc. and incorporating it into a Python project is simple. You could even fine-tune it to your specific use cases with moderate effort, by providing sample request / response pairs that it should emulate.

Here's an analogy - building your own foundational model is a bit like raising a child through college. It takes a lot of learning just to get a child to be able to speak, read, and write, and then to teach them basic facts about the world. Fine tuning is a bit like taking a college graduate who already has acquired those skills and training them to work at your company.

Now, in theory, there's no reason Google couldn't go and adopt orphaned babies, raise them to adulthood, give them a good education, and then hire them on as employees. But even apart from how creepy and dystopian it would be, it would also be a huge waste of Google's money, because they can also take adults who were raised on someone else's dime and give them the extra training they need to be successful at Google. That is vastly faster and vastly cheaper for Google to do, and it's also going to be vastly faster and cheaper to use a foundational model that someone else made and just fine-tune for your needs.

Depending on the effort and time you're willing to put in, you can make some fairly significantly different models just by fine-tuning an existing model."

1je7j49,you can try using something like chatterbot perhaps?
1je7j49,This is kinda more a question for others since this gave me an idea. Is it feasible to build out your own NLP using existing libraries in python?
1je7j49,"There are several options, depending on what you mean by ""make my own AI"". In rough order of complexity/difficulty (easy --> impossible)

  
Option 1. Use python to call an AI model using whatever SDK. https://github.com/openai/openai-python. You're not really making your own AI, but you can plug it into some personal workflow or app or something.

Option 2. Use Ollama (https://ollama.com/) to run your own AI on your own hardware (local, or cloud instance). You could then ""customize"" it to an extent: https://medium.com/@sumudithalanz/unlocking-the-power-of-large-language-models-a-guide-to-customization-with-ollama-6c0da1e756d9. Not really necessary, but if you wanted you could use python to call the local/cloud api you created, just for ease of use and to tick the ""python"" box.

Option 3: Train an AI on your own dataset (https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/tabular-bq-prediction)

Option 4: Build your own neural network: [https://realpython.com/python-ai-neural-network/](https://realpython.com/python-ai-neural-network/)

There are about a million other options, again depending on what you actually mean/want to achieve. Also your definition of ""AI"" (e.g LLM, vs machine learning, etc.)"
1je7j49,"Not any time soon since, respectfully, you do not even seem to know what AI is. You seem ambitious, which is good! But you need to understand that AI is not just some program that you write; its core principles are based on advanced mathematics. You need to really understand the theory before you attempt to build your own model without libraries like TenserFlow. So if you want to work in AI, then find a course/textbook on machine learning and start there.

On the other hand, you can use libraries and probably get a terrible language model running within an hour of ""vibe"" coding."
1je7j49,You should first understand how AI works. Python comes later.
1je7j49,Yes you can. Check out Neural Networks from Scratch in Python.

Its even easier with pytorch and perhaps huggingface. With just a few lines of code you can get started with a local LLM

1jde21p,"I will just put the details of what I usually do when I want to learn a new language.

I usually go to YouTube and watch some videos about how the language came into existence, what problems it solves, and why it became popular. That helps me understand the purpose of the language and where it fits in the programming world.



After that, I try to find a beginner-friendly tutorial series - there are plenty of good ones on YouTube or free platforms like freeCodeCamp or Codecademy. I follow along with the videos and code along in an online Python editor like Replit or download Python and use VSCode or PyCharm (Community version).



Once I get the basics like variables, loops, functions, and data types, I try to build something small on my own, like a calculator or a simple to-do list. That helps reinforce what I’ve learned.

Most importantly, be consistent - coding a little every day helps a lot. Don’t worry if you get stuck. Google and Stack Overflow are your best friends. :)

1jde21p,Is Programming with Mosh on YouTube a good place to start? 
1jde21p,"I suggest figure out why you are considering learning programming to begin with. 

Answer the question of what would you accomplish  if you knew all the python? 

Simple answer like get good job hides the complexity of the following: Providing real value as a sw developer by fitting in a particular biz model is not a simplle task. There is more knowledge beyond simply knowing all the python and IT related domain specifics (of some specific field that u will end up serving by developing code after you have succeeded)

U have to set a clear goal of what value shall u provide a to whom slecifically (yourself or some other particular person or group who are not yet satisfied with available IT solutions). At the very least have some sort of thirst to quench like Maybe solving a first simplest leetcode problem keeps you awake at night. U rly dont provide any context.

Then learn the basics of python, like bare minimun, to get some initial half baked variant of a solution. Pick smth like vars, conditionals, loops, fns, running single file, couple of weeks and thats it. Then have a go at the problem you are trying to solve. From there figure out whats missing from your toolset. Idk i.e. u for some reason need concurrency or whatever.

Learn HOW TO PROVIDE VALUE to uself or someone (real) other BY CODING and that is what sets apart people who cant land a coding job vs those who get an offer after having and hour long convo with tech side.

Ppl who assume that u fit it somewhere at some company like a piece of puzzle after a bootcamp are a bit late. Sadly there is no more bubble in the industry anymore that would warrant quotas for such 'staff accumulation'.

You have to figure out the subtle parts for yourself here. Sw dev does not have a scientific discipline to follow, otherwise we would approach it differently. (There are no online bootcamps to become X or Y scientist afaik lmao). Yet still u are expected to provide the end working mechanism that would be reproducible and flexible enough to withstand the consant stream of change."

I'll just put it like this.

I went back to graduate school 10 years after my undergrad to get a masters and a PhD. 

It took me 6 years.

My learning plan never went more than about 6-9 months out. And I took a hard left turn in what I was going to study at the end of my first year.

Someone else commented that your learning plan looks like it's going to take 3-5 years. Frankly I think that's lowballing it by a factor of at least 2. Probably more. I'd consider  a much leaner plan that gives you flexibility to go in a different direction as you learn about exactly what it is you want to do.

Get the fundamentals under your belt, get an application or two knocked out, then evaluate where you want to go next."

Is in a production environment, and if so, is this a PLC you are authorized to access this way? If this is for learning in a lab or on your own hardware, then have at it. But if you are doing this at an actual factory or plant and starting from ""how to install Python"", then I would take a step back, and make sure you know what you're doing. End of security nagging.

What PLC brand? They vary a lot. Best place to start would be the vendor's documentation. Python has a pymodbus package that can do RTU or TCP messaging. There are packages for OPC UA as well. You should be able to just search them. It doesn't matter how you install Python, just do it your favorite way. If you don't have a favorite way, I'd recommend the official installer for Windows, and whatever is in the distribution's native repository for Linux. Then learn how to work in virtual environments, which is where you'd install your dependencies.

If you're someone who already understands Modbus and OPC but not Python, you could consider something like Node Red to poll the PLC data periodically and stuff if into a more friendly environment (like a database). That would require less boilerplate."

1jdcnnd,"pathlib is the more modern, Pythonic way to deal with paths and path/file-related operations. There’s no reason not to use it. Lots of code uses the older ways, and it’s not wrong.

1jdcnnd,"> But in downloading other repos I noticied most people still use OS for search or string concatenation.

`os` has been around for a lot longer, that is all."
1jdcnnd,"There are a few situations where I might not use `pathlib`. 

One is where I'm interacting with something which doesn't provide or accept `Path` objects. While I could convert back to string after manipulation, if the manipulation itself is relatively simple I think it looks cleaner to just use `os.path` in this case.

Another is when there's some feature of an `os.path` function that isn't implemented in its `pathlib` 'replacement'. For example `os.path.relpath` would handle walking upwards for a relative path while `Path.relative_to` didn't until Python 3.12.

```
import os.path
from pathlib import Path

os.path.relpath(""/usr"", ""/usr/bin"")  # '..'
Path(""/usr"").relative_to(""/usr/bin"")  # ValueError

# 3.12 or later
Path(""/usr"").relative_to(""/usr/bin"", walk_up=True)  # Path('..')
```

The final one is if I'm being **extremely** fussy about import time. `os.path` is (almost) always imported on startup by Python, while `pathlib` is not and so you incur a small performance penalty on startup. However if you're importing some other heavyweight libraries this is largely irrelevant, especially so if *they* import `pathlib`."

Do not convert the values to floats, use int.  You will want to use these values to access the character.

find the max value for x, and the max y.  These are the maximum dimensions of the matrix.

Create a dictionary,  I'll call it matrix and store the c associated with the x,y.  You can index a dict with a tuple.

Create a nested loop for loop for the y and x to or from max\_x, max\_y.  Use the values from the for loop to get the c from the dict or a space if (x,y) is not in the dict."
1jdknx3,"Another approach would be to derive a list of row data from the html data, with each row containing the  x-coordinate , character, & y-coordinate. 

	1. Sort the list by the y-coordinate and then by the x-coordinate.    
	2. Use the sorted list to determine the maximum x-coordinate and use this number + 1 as the maximum line width.   
	3. For each row, create an empty line, linewidth wide.    
		a. Store each character in the empty line according to its x-coordinate.    
		b. When each row is complete, print the row.

Of course, all coordinate values need to be ints.   
You might find it easier to make the empty line a list of space characters. This will allow you to replace the appropriate space character like this:
~~~
line[x] = character
~~~
To print the line, you’d use the join() like this:

1jcyw88,"Very general rule of thumb: if the structure is something where I want to use the name of something as the key, I use a dataclass instead of a dictionary with strings. If I am using a structure that mimics an else-if, I use a dictionary instead.

To answer your question, one cool thing about dataclasses is you know all your keys ahead of time, and your IDE can help you ensure you use the right one and don’t misspell it."
1jcyw88,"When creating a dataclass object you are forced to initialize the specific attributes in the class definition, leaving less room for error. Your IDE will list those attributes with autocomplete on your dataclass object. Dataclasses can also contain methods, operators, etc. just like a normal class."
1jcyw88,"Dictionaries are for unstructured data. 

Dataclasses are for structured data."
1jcyw88,"Not a single person has mentioned memory yet..

If you use a `dataclass`, specifically with `slots=True`, your memory usage can be significantly reduced. If you've got a handful of your sets of data, you won't care. When you've got a few hundred thousand or a few million, you'll appreciate that `dataclass` is much smaller."
1jcyw88,"Basically any time I need to create multiple instances, I’m going with a dataclass over a dictionary. Or if attributes are going to be of different types. Or even just if I know the keys ahead of time. Really, any time I can reasonably use a dataclass over a dict I will"
1jcyw88,"Rule of thumb: 

    - You know exactly what keys you'll get => Dataclass
    - You don't => Dict



Dataclasses are **nicer from a user perspective** \- 

You don't need to ask if it has a key - it always does, you can put in methods and other OOP-ish things, etc.



Dicts are more flexible in terms of **keys**. 

For example, if you have a sparse grid, like a 2d map of city blocks or a Minecraft 3d world, you can chuck in as big a map as your RAM allows using coordinates as keys - you could not do this in a Dataclass, because you cannot manually write out all possible coordinate tuples.



Dicts are also more flexible in terms of **space**. 

If your dataclass would need to have 30 Optionals, you will waste a ton of memory on all the Nones. With a dict, you only pay memory for the keys you use."
1jcyw88,"You 100% can just use dicts. You could also store everything as a string.

Dataclasses come with some cool things like enabling default dunder methods and post init routes. That plus your normal benefits of classes.

If you just need it to hold data, sure, use a dictionary. But if you want some default dunders, start doing input validation checks, modifications upon init, and behaviors for each of those inputs, you could prob opt for the dataclass.

Not to mention a lot of validation libraries like pydantic and other ORMs will be based off these."
1jcyw88,"If you have the sort of structured data that makes sense to be stored in a dataclass, you _could_ store it in a dictionary. However, a dataclass makes things a lot more explicit for:
* you working on the code - you will find it easier to read, especially if you come back to it after an interval 
* someone else coming along later and reading your code
* your IDE which is likely to be able to offer code completion and validation for the dataclass version 
* Python itself, which will likely give better runtime error messages if you get something wrong"
1jcyw88,"My rule of thumb:

- If I’m making the objects myself, `@dataclass`.
- If I’m parsing moderately-nested JSON, `typing.ThpedDict`"
1jcyw88,"Read the docs. The dataclass decorator automatically generates special methods for your class including __init__() and __repr__(). If that's useful to you, use dataclass."
1jcyw88,"In general, you shouldn't be substituting one for the other. A dictionary is a container, a dataclass is an object; while common, the use cases should be completely different.

A dictionary *should* map exactly one type to exactly one type. Simply, it should only store strings, or only ints, but more specifically, those strings or ints should be the same *type* of data. I.e., storing a list of student grades is good--they're all grades--but storing a name, an address, and a city is a flag you should be using something more sophisticated than a dictionary. Even though they are all strings, they're not actually the same type of data. A dictionary is a collection, so it would be very common to store objects **in** a dictionary, but not equate them.

A dataclass is an object, which *should* be a type. A type is not a collection of types, but instead a ""merging"" of several pieces of data into a *single* type. A dataclass should be related more to a NamedTuple in your mind than a dictionary.

Note that the prevalence of JSON has made the boundary between these two very blurry because JSON uses the dict *syntax* to serialize objects. However, keep in mind that JSON is a ***serialization language***, not Python, and the rules for the two shouldn't be confused.

So: multiple different pieces of data that together define one thing: a dataclass; multiple similar pieces of data that are part of a single collection: use a collection type--which includes dictionaries.

See also [this post](/r/learnpython/comments/1j4ia9n/when_should_i_use_a_list_dictionary_tuple_or_set/) where I go more into depth about types vs. collections, and should help explain the ""more like a tuple"" comment above."

You can also use another shared memory store, a database or a file on disk to store your list. Whatever option you choose, make sure that there’s no conflicting concurrent update."

Keep in mind that `git` and `GitHub` are not the same thing.

GitHub is very popular, but there are many alternative accessible repositories that support the git protocol, including Gitlab and Bit Bucket.

There are also self-host options using, for example, [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/products/gitea/) or [GitLab Community Edition](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce).

Git was originally created (by the same person that created Linux) as the Version Control Software (VCS) market offerings were very expensive at one time (as was the case with Unix). There are competing options, including Apache Subversion and Mercurial.   

It is important and useful to learn to use VCS early on to help with code development, making it easier to experiment and try different things out. The public repositories are also a great learning resource.

The public repositories can also be a useful learning resource, although the risk in learning from these repositories is that they often contain huge amounts of bad practice (in terms of project setup and repository structure, rather than the code itself). There is no doubt a list somewhere of great example projects you could review, but I have not looked."
1jd7wpo,"Remember never to commit any type of password or secret key to git, this is one of the most common mistakes made by those new to git. If your project is public, the whole history is also public, so even if you later remove the password, it's still there."
1jd7wpo,"hence it's very helpful and a good practice to keep the commits focued on a feature. Then when you maybe need to revert a change you only alter that particular piece of code.

This also helps preventing feature creep of commits. At first it might be counter-intuitive, but in the long run it's a very good habit."
1jd7wpo,"- git and GitHub are different. GitHub is essentially hosted git, with some extensions and a pretty interface.
- you can push to GitHub on private projects.
- there’s not much value in pushing things that don’t work (exception when you want someone else to look at it and fix errors)
- branches are good things, not everything has to be on main
- private projects can use GitHub as offsite backup or deployment mechanism, collaboration isn’t necessary.
- having a history that tells when and why individual lines were changed is very useful

(I am currently re-writing some very old code written in the before times when syntax highlighting itself was fairly new but common, i.e. the mid-1990s, and holy shit it is FULL of variables I am not using.  Probably I was once using them and refactored, or thought I'd need them but didn't)"

1jcw7mn,"In my experience, it makes it much much easier to catch mistakes.

It can write code either which way, doesn’t make much difference in actually writing it, 

But in my colour scheme, variables are blue and functions are yellow. If I write something that I’m expecting to be a particular thing, and it doesn’t highlight in the colour I expect, I know that something is wrong.

It helps me catch a lot of syntax and formatting errors, that would be more difficult to catch through error messages alone.

Things like white space, indentation, good identifier choice, comment style, module and API design all exist to help people understand what the code is intended to do.

Programmers worked for decades with punch cards and hard copy terminals, then plain text terminals.  It worked. And worked well enough.  But there were gaps and opportunities for improvement.

Syntax highlight, formatters, spell check, snips libraries, and now, AI assistants all make the programmers job easier.

I say take advantage of all the improvements you can."

Others do like these things, in varying degrees.

Having an IDE point out that you've missed a space or a semicolon is a wonderful thing and I appreciate it all the more when I have to remote into a system and rely on the default vi install instead of having all the fancy features that come with a modern IDE. 

It's not like things never got created before modern IDEs, just that they help make everything run smoothly. The reason I got into software development is because I'm a lazy man who hates repetition. Hitting the auto format button makes me more efficient."
1jcw7mn,"There is a limit to how much code you can write before it becomes un-debuggable. That is, if you average X errors per line of code, eventually you will have accumulated so many errors spread across so much code that debugging one large block of code becomes more work than debugging two smaller blocks of code.

So the more errors you can catch *before* debugging, the more efficient your coding process. This is what formatting, coloring, linting, and type checking are for--to catch errors fast enough that they are obvious *while you are still typing that line of code*. That is, a spellchecker vs a proofreader."
1jcw7mn,"In a professional environment, it won't be uncommon to enforce formatting and linting as a pre commit hook. If the editor can do it as I go, all the better.
I personally find it very useful when my editor tells me of an unknown module/variable (through linter) and can automatically add the import.

If you're asking about syntax highlighting only, it surely makes reading code easier, even the one you just wrote. It is certainly easier than no highlight at all, as long as it's not too distracting."

1jd9n3w,"There is no ""get() method in Python"" as though it were a universal feature of the language. Each class defines its own methods, and two methods with the same name in different classes are entirely separate from each other. 

As for the get() of a dictionary, this writeup is short and to the point. https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_dictionary_get.asp

get() on a dictionary returns the value of the key you specify (like mydict[key] does). But if the key doesn't exist, it returns None (instead of throwing an exception), or you can specify what value to return in that case via an optional second argument."
1jd9n3w,"https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.get

get(key, default=None)

""Return the value for key if key is in the dictionary, else default. If default is not given, it defaults to None, so that this method never raises a KeyError."""
1jd9n3w,"This is one way to use it:

    my_counter = dict()
    numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
    for num in numbers:
        my_counter[num] = my_counter.get(num, 0) + 1

  
Dictionaries raises `KeyError` if key does not exist in the dictionary. `dict.get` lets you provide a default value for when the key doesn't exist, so you don't get an exception. In the above example, we return 0 if the key does not exist. 

This pattern has largely been replaced by defaultdict. But `dict.get` is still useful in some very niche cases."
1jd92be,"You can't just ask for the max of a list of strings. What would that mean? So we need to tell Python exactly how to sort the list so that we can take the first item, and we do that by telling it to use the `len` function as the key to sort by."
1jd92be,"This is where looking at the python documentation is useful:

[max(iterable, *, key=None)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max):
""There are two optional keyword-only arguments. The key argument specifies a one-argument ordering function like that used for list.sort(). The default argument specifies an object to return if the provided iterable is empty. If the iterable is empty and default is not provided, a ValueError is raised.""

That's a bit impenetrable, but whats happening is that the `max` function has been told: ""apply this `len` function to each item in the list, and return the item in the list with the largest result of that function."", i.e. the max function makes an internal list like this:
```
lengths = [len(w) for w in words]
```
and returns the corresponding word for the largest length."
1jd92be,"Have you tried the docs? [https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max)

Max just takes an iterable and returns the biggest thing. In the example you've provided, it determines that by using the len function.

You could just as easily write your own code to iterate over a list if you wanted.

    def longest_word(sentence):
        biggest_word = """"

Without a WSGI server, every request would need to start a new Python process, making the app slow. A WSGI server keeps the Python app running and handles requests efficiently. So, you do need an WSGI server like gunicorn or uwsgi.

WSGI servers typically run on unprivileged ports (e.g., 8000 or 8080) because binding to standard ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) requires root privileges. So, if you want your app to be accessible via normal HTTPS, you need to proxy it through nginx.

Nginx also serves static files more efficiently and provides other important benefits, such as handling slow clients without blocking your app and securing your application by terminating HTTPS."
1jd2fts,"WSGI is just a protocol that (usually/always?) python uses to host web services

Yes, you do have to use it.  Is it a big deal, nah?  You just run uwsgi or gunicorn (or uviciron for async), point it at your python app and it basically acts like an interpreter that runs your web service.  Both options have a lot of ways to run multiple instances of your app, using processes, threads, gthreads, etc.

Javascript frameworks tend to just serve up http servers directly.  It's just a different approach but it's not... really that different?  For JS you run ""node ./src/index.js"" and for python you run ""gunicorn"" with the path to your app.

WSGI doesn't go ""between"" nginx and your python app.  WSGI \*serves\* your python app"

You want to use the bind method to update the stringvar because the .set() method isn't called when you simply update the txt stringvariable, as this method is only called with widgets. At least I think that's what's going on.

Edit: You can GENERALIZE this like follows:

    def generate_txt(txt_gt):
        return ""Generated Text: "" + txt_gt
    def update_tkvar(tkvar, new_val):
        tkvar.set(generate_txt(generate_txt(new_val)))

1jco217,"I’d say it depends on what makes the problem difficult. For instance if you were constructing a language parser one of the most difficult parts might be handling the enormous amount of edge cases and handling introducing new language rules that might break existing rules. For a problem like this I’d approach the problem with TDD. There are other difficulty domains too such as performance, security, logical complexity, problem size, stringent deadline, etc.

If the problem is difficult because it’s logically complex as it sounds is your case I typically do the basics as others suggested (break into pieces, take breaks, consult others, etc.).

One I might add I haven’t seen suggested: Get a single hardcoded case to work. It’s easier to focus on a single case without worrying about all “well what if the input is structured this way” type of thoughts. In my experience solving 1-3 hardcoded cases lends itself to revealing the general solution (or at least sheds light on it) about 70-80% of the time."

1jczvuy,"It's actually even weirder than it appears

Like, I messed around with this a bit, and the last thing I've tried is settings room_1 2 and 3 to the exact same set of data - i.e. comment out room_2 and room_3 and make new ones that are just the same as room_1, like

    room_1 = ItemPilesInRoom(((0, 1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6, 7), (8, 9, 10, 11), (12, 13, 14, 15)))
    room_2 = ItemPilesInRoom(((0, 1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6, 7), (8, 9, 10, 11), (12, 13, 14, 15)))
    room_3 = ItemPilesInRoom(((0, 1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6, 7), (8, 9, 10, 11), (12, 13, 14, 15)))

This *still* makes a set with 3 items, not 1 like I'd expect.  I tried with or without the sorting step, which shouldn't matter.  Tried sorting only at the point the hash is generated, doesn't matter.

I verified that when you create the set, it calls the hash for each object, and that the hash is what we expect

At the moment, I don't know how to explain this except that set() does not seem to operate the way I'd expect it to."
1jczvuy,"OK I think I figured it out.  I looked at the docs for \_\_hash\_\_

""The \_\_hash\_\_() method should return an integer. The only required property is that objects which compare equal have the same hash value""

Once I added \_\_eq\_\_ to the mix it does what you'd expect

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return hash(self) == hash(other)"
1jczvuy,"I think you've solved the issue, but another thing I'll point out: since the order of the piles in the room doesn't matter, why not use an unordered collection to store them? Probably a `frozenset` since you need to hash the collection itself in addition to the items inside it."
1jczvuy,"Shouldn't the last loop be ""for room in no_duplicates"" instead of ""for room in all_rooms""?

1jcwdxy,"The class doesn't hold any state. Therefore, it shouldn't be a class, even if ""menu"" is a noun. Just make these methods regular functions."
1jcwdxy,"To answer your question, the reason you're not going back to the ```main()``` function, is because the methods in Menus are circular (each method calls another method).

The real problem with this code is that your Menus class isn't being treated as an object, but rather functions wrapped in a class. This is clear when you see that each method in your class doesn't take ```self``` as a positional argument in any method, and each method has a path that creates another instance of that class, but those instances aren't stored in a variable or attribute of the class and are garbage collected. 

As another commenter suggested, just ditch the class and treat these as functions. If you want to use classes, then read up a little more on classes in python and how they differ from other languages."

And indeed, dictionaries *don't* have an attribute you can call called ""result."" Why did you think that they did? Or did you not know that the members of `swarm` were dictionaries? You must know that, since you told us they were and you confirm that they are in your code."

1jcugow,"It's always best to include the prompt with these kinds of questions. Obviously there are 86400 seconds in a day. My first guess at a glance is it wants you to print the statement ""x days is x\*86400 seconds"" for a specific amount of days.

Build a calculator. 

It should allow the user to enter an expression, and give an answer. 

First start with simple ones, like 25+56, 25\*56, 25/56, etc

Then slightly complicated, like 10 factorial, 10\^5, log(10)

Then with more operands. 25+56+10, 25+56-10, 25-56+10!

Test it so it can handle divide by 0 errors

If you want, then build a graphical user interface that looks like a calculator. 

Then add scientific calculations, like sin, cosine, etc. 

Add statistical functionality, like mean, median. 

Add matrix operations. 

Add ability to solve equations. Add ability to display equations as graphs. Keep going at it. 

Build a fully fledged graphical calculator.

The majority of the basics are second nature to me and now I just need to read the documentation for the Python module I'm importing and I""m good to go. 

Long and short of what I'm saying is, don't get hung up on knowing or not knowing something. Focus on the basics, utilize them in projects, and get those down. Once you do, you'll be fine.

I think therefore your question is why does the hello and the 8 appear on different lines? The answer is simply that print() inserts a newline at the end. So the first print (of ""hello"") ends the line, so when fun() returns and it prints 8, that is on a new line."

1jcsxo7,"*edit Yes, I did some digging and both of those certifications are offered from Google direct. That would be my personal recommendation

I personally have signed up for one of these with a different name and paid a similar amount. I won't say which one in case others have had more luck then me

Ya, I REGRET it. I was working as an intern and learned a fraction of what I thought I would. Ended up re-enrolling in college and graduating with an Associate's degree

So is it a scam? I would say some people would say yes, it is a scam. However, others would tell you it is not 🤷

This is just my opinion. You need ACCREDITED courses my friend. If the credits transfer to a local college or university, you're golden 👌

I know two guys who took a single class in college who both got certifications afterwards. They are both still employed and that was a decade ago 

IMHO you'd be better off learning on your own through books etc. and using that knowledge to gain real world experience. It's a lot cheaper too

You can always test afterwards for certifications once you learn. Doesn't Google offer that certificate directly from them?"
